Code for this assignment can be found in the static/js folder in the file app.js. 
When not sure what code to use or how to use it, I refered to class notes, instructor examples/demonstration, and, per instructor recommendation, utilized ChatGPT to help learn how to do it. Otherwise, no other code or outside resources were used.
